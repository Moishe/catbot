catbot
===

_A simple framework to write simple, stateful bots._

This framework will listen to all messages delivered to any channel it's invited to.

The bot framework is triggered by a message whose first character is a "?"

When the framework hears a message like this, it treats it as a command in the following format:

```?module-name arg1 arg2 ...```

The framework will attempt to load the module identified by the module-name param. If it exists,
the framework will pass the `args` as one array (user is the first element), as well as a storage
factory that the module can use to request storage objects for users (which might be the sender or
identified by args), a storage object for the module, or a global storage object.

Quick Start
---

Clone this repo and get all its dependencies:

```git clone https://github.com/Moishe/catbot.git```

```cd catbot```

```npm install```

Set up a [custom integration for your team](https://api.slack.com/bot-users). Get the API token for the bot, and then run:

```SLACK_API_TOKEN=[token] npm start```

Now you can `/invite catbot` into your channels, and try `?++ foo` to make sure it's working.

You can add new modules in the `modules` directory; look at `echo.js` and `++.js` for sample code.

*Note:* If you want to use the ?meme module, you'll also need to install the imagemagick binaries:

```brew install imagemagick```

Tutorial with Heroku
---

* Create a NodeJS app in Heroku
* Connect your new Heroku app to your github repo which has fork of the catbot
* Select automatic deploy on commit
* In Settings, set `BOT_NAME` and `SLACK_API_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`
* Make your code changes and commit to your github repo
* Changes will be auto deployed !


Things to do / errata
---

Tests should be much better, including better per-module tests.

Note that `user` is the first parameter after module specifier. Currently the module handler() method doesn't
receive any data about the user who actually typed the command. I suspect this would be useful.

Allow modules to describe the kind of input they expect. Right now I'm assuming that the first argument is a
user (and doing things with storage with that assumption). Certain modules might not care about a user (eg ?meme)
and shouldn't get "user" storage set up.

Relatedly, currently the 'user' parameter can be any string. It _might_ be more sensible to enforce it to be a reference
to a user (eg @foo) for consistency but doing that removes some use cases, like "?endorse rain for making things wet".

"Chaining" modules might be nice -- effectively letting a module return a ?command (or an array of them) for the runner
to process. Eg. let ?endorse chain to ?++.

Storage right now is very very na√Øve, just using the node implementation of localStorage, which maps to files.
Would be much better to use SQLite for this.

Right now the bot exposes an empty web page. I would love it if each module could return a blob of HTML describing
stats for users or other module-specific renderings, and then put those on the page. For instance, if someone
implemented a ?meme bot, it would be fun to show the last _n_ memes. Similarly, the ++ bot could expose a "pluses leaderboard".
